Mortgage approval process, that we practiced on KIE, considers various parameters for automating the decision process. Accordingly, we practised automation of rules definition in the KIE.

The class works has improvement potential to improve the application cognition â€“ on multiple dimensions


One one such dimension, I have further augmented the system for some additional automations.

1)	Credit score: Singapore credit bureau maintains a rating of individuals, 1000-2000. Where 1000 is high likelihood of default, and 2000 is low likely of default. See Ref [1]. To keep the default rate within 1% of the bank loans, i.e.credit rating of 1825and above qualify for automatic approval. Suspect credit rating score area is highlighted in red.
